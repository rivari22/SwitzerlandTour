                        <p>It’s a fascinating and rather humbling experience to visit this museum, which documents the work of the Red Cross from the humanitarian vision outlined by founder Henry Dunant in 1863, through its work during so many conflicts and natural disasters since then. Completed renovated in 2013, the museum’s permanent exhibition, entitled The Humanitarian Adventure, divides the experience into three sections: the first deals with the agency’s founding principles; the second explores how the Red Cross helps families separated by war or genocide; and the third details its work during and after natural disasters. </p>

                        <p>It's not the MoMa, the Louvre or the Tate, but Zurich's art museum has a lot to offer and a good collection of modern art. Lovers of Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti will be thrilled to walk through the ground floor rooms dedicated to this artist alone, and the likes of Van Gogh, Monet and Chagall are displayed in small but bright rooms on the top floor.</p>

                        <p>Known as Geneva’s local mountain, the Salève is actually just over the border in France. But the Genevois are justified in staking their claim, as this natural haven is just 20 minutes by bus from the city centre. It’s refreshing to slip out of Geneva’s money-focused commercial centre and head so easily into nature. From the cable car at Veyrier it’s a short ride up to 1,379m from where you’ll gape at the city and lake sprawled far below. A number of hiking paths meander over the mountain, including one which leads through the woods and on to an open meadow, the perfect spot for a picnic or snooze in the sun with a view of Mont Blanc.</p>
